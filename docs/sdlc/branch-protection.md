# Branch protection

Both `main` and `staging` are protected by GitHub repository rulesets.
The settings mirror each other — the same quality gate applies to both
branches so that code hitting staging has already passed CI.

## Why a merge queue on staging

Without a merge queue, approving two PRs in quick succession leads to
the second one going stale (its CI ran against the old base). A human
would have to come back, click "Update branch", wait for CI again, then
merge. The merge queue eliminates this: approve multiple PRs, they queue
up, GitHub rebases each against the latest staging head, runs CI, and
merges sequentially — no human round-trips.

## Ruleset: Protect staging

| Rule | Setting | Rationale |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Deletion | blocked | Prevent accidental branch deletion |
| Force push | blocked | Preserve history for audit trail |
| Require PR | 1 approval, dismiss stale reviews on push | Human code review gate |
| Required status checks | `test`, `e2e` (strict) | CI must pass against latest base |
| Merge queue | squash, all-green, 5 max entries, 5 min wait | Batch without conflicts |

**Merge method:** squash — keeps staging history clean and one commit per
feature for easy UAT tracing.

**Strict status checks:** PRs must be up-to-date with staging before
merge. The merge queue handles this automatically.

## Ruleset: Protect main

| Rule | Setting | Rationale |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Deletion | blocked | Never delete main |
| Force push | blocked | History is sacred |
| Required status checks | `test`, `e2e` (strict) | Same CI gate as staging |
| Merge queue | squash, all-green, 5 max entries, 5 min wait | Batch promotions cleanly |

**Note:** Main's ruleset (ID `15901122`) was created 2026-05-03 and is
currently `enforcement: disabled`. Enable it when ready to enforce the
merge queue on promotion PRs.

## Bypass actors

**Staging:** The admin repository role (which includes GitHub Actions
workflows running with `contents: write`) is configured as a bypass
actor. This allows the `promote-staging.yml` workflow to push
conflict-resolution commits directly to `staging` without opening a
separate PR. Human contributors still go through the PR + merge queue
flow.

**Main:** No bypass actors. All changes must go through a PR.

## Skipping staging (fast-track to main)

For non-user-visible changes (docs, CI workflows, markdown-only) you
can merge directly to `main` by opening a PR with `base: main`. When
this happens, `sync-staging.yml` fires on the push to `main` and
automatically merges main back into staging so it stays current.

Fast-track is appropriate when:
- All changes are `*.md`, `.github/workflows/`, or other non-deployed files
- The change doesn't need UAT validation on the staging URL
- You're confident the change won't conflict with in-flight staging work

If the reverse-sync encounters conflicts, it escalates to
`@danielsperoni` via a comment on the open promotion PR (or a new issue
if none exists).

## Interaction with the promote-staging workflow

The `promote-staging.yml` workflow creates/updates a PR targeting main.
When the merge queue is active on main, approving and merging that PR
enters it into the queue — CI runs one final time against main's head
before the actual merge lands.

If the promotion PR has conflicts:
1. The workflow attempts automatic resolution via Claude
2. If resolution fails, it labels the PR `status: needs-human`, posts
   an escalation comment, and requests review from `@danielsperoni`
3. The `/resolve-conflicts` command remains available for manual retries

## How to modify these rules

Rulesets are managed via the GitHub API or the repo Settings > Rules UI:
- Staging: `gh api repos/danielsperoniteam/fhir-place/rulesets/16171731`
- Main: `gh api repos/danielsperoniteam/fhir-place/rulesets/15901122`

Changes to branch protection are SDLC changes and require human review.
