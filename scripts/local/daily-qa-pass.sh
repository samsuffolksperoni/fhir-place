# Local driver for the daily QA pass prompt. Replaces the GHA
# `daily-qa-pass.yml` workflow for local execution.
#
# Heavier than the other drivers: boots the demo dev server pointed at
# the SMART Health IT R4 sandbox (VITE_USE_MOCK=false — same env the GHA
# workflow uses) before invoking the prompt, then tears it down on exit.
# The QA prompt's Step 1 is `curl -fsS http://localhost:5173` and it bails
# if the server isn't there, so a wrapper that just delegates would
# always exit before running any QA.
#
# Refuses to run if :5173 is already in use — a pre-existing dev server
# is likely VITE_USE_MOCK=true, which would walk the agent through a
# mocked app and file false bugs.
#
# See scripts/run-prompt-locally.sh for the shared runner.
