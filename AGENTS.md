# Codex Notes

## General

- Keep context small; read only files relevant to the active issue.
- Before implementation, summarize a short plan (2–4 bullet points).
- Prefer existing patterns over new abstractions.
- Treat GitHub issue acceptance criteria as the source of truth.
- After changes, report: files changed, tests run, risks, and follow-ups.

## E2E test maintenance

- Every user-facing change needs a test update in the same PR.
- New page or route → new spec in `apps/demo/e2e/`.
- New component on an existing page → add assertions to the relevant spec.
- Visual/layout change → run `playwright test --update-snapshots`, review
  the diff, and commit the updated PNGs.
- Bug fix → add a regression test asserting the broken state no longer occurs.
- Use `data-testid` selectors; avoid CSS class names and positional selectors.
- See `apps/demo/e2e/README.md` for the full test map and update rules.

## QA agent

When asked to do a QA pass on the demo app:

1. Ensure the dev server is running: `pnpm --filter @fhir-place/demo dev`.
2. Run the full e2e suite first: `pnpm --filter @fhir-place/demo e2e`.
   If any test fails, that is already a filed bug — do not re-file it.
3. For exploratory coverage beyond the suite, follow `docs/qa-agent.md`.
4. File each new bug as a GitHub issue using the `agent-work-item` template
   with concrete reproduction steps, expected vs. actual behavior, and the
   URL/route where the defect occurs.
5. Do not fix bugs during the same QA pass — file first, fix in a separate PR.

## Staging-first deploys

- Branch off `origin/staging`, not `origin/main`.
- Open every PR with `base: staging`. Humans promote `staging` → `main`
  after live UAT — agents never target `main` directly.
- Every PR body must include a **UAT on live staging** section with
  concrete steps a human or downstream agent can run against
  `https://samsuffolksperoni.github.io/fhir-place/staging/` once the
  change is merged and Pages has redeployed. If you cannot articulate
  those steps, the change is not ready.
- The Pages workflow rebuilds both branches on every push; staging's
  build going green is part of "done."

## Safety rules (see docs/decisions/0003-agent-safety-rules.md)

- Small, issue-scoped changes only.
- Never delete production data, modify secrets, or force-push `main` or `staging`.
- All code changes go through a PR; do not merge without human review.
